                 <p> We know you love technology. You listen to music, play games online and on your phones, and browse websites all day long. At Camp K12, we take your relationship with Technology to a whole new level by transforming you into a creator rather than a user of these things.Don’t just play games, make them. Don’t just listen to Avicci and Hardwell, make your own EDM. Make your own movies, animations, designs, and mobile apps, because you can, and because it’s fun to be able to turn your ideas into reality. Come build with us.</p>

                        <p>Some say it’s “never too late” to start, but at Camp K12 we believe it’s never too early. We chose to build our courses for KG – 12 students (hence the K12 in our name) rather than colleges because frankly, college is too late. Our goal is to work with impressionable young minds and to inculcate in them the healthy habits of problem solving and creativity. We want students in Indian schools to develop a sense of confidence in their abilities to create and an addiction to innovation — a muscle memory for building apps, movies, music, animations, graphics, and games.We feel that it is this early exposure and positive habits that will allow our campers in India to be the makers, doers, and entrepreneurs of tomorrow.</p>

Campers complete multiple exciting projects right from day one, and work their way up to a Final Project which they showcase to their parents, teachers, and school principal on the final day of the camp.Our campers work on projects for causes and organizations they are passionate about or that solve real-world problems. Examples include Android Apps for the Disabled, Games to teach a new language to a child, Cards for a family member’s birthday or festival, TV advertisements about Android vs. iOS platforms, and Websites for their school clubs.</p>

No matter where you are in the country, you can sign up and put your creativity and skills to the test against your classmates all over nation.Our 2015 Competition was run in collaboration with Adobe India, and included themes such as “Design iPhone 10”, “Create an Android game with Flying Objects”, create a “TV ad for iOS vs Android”, and “Design a website for the imaginary celebrity Yo! Yo! Money Singh”. Check out the competition recap video to see what the winners created for these themes.</p>

                            Our experience with Camp K12 has been a very positive one. They offer a unique blend of hands-on education and fun for the campers, and their bright and young instructors are able to connect with our students in ways that few others can. Through just a single 40 hour course, Camp K-12 shared with our students the exciting process of creative creation and transformed them into dedicated innovators.

From creating  designing one’s own website, students learnt effective ways to use the Internet with responsibility. There was a quantitative leap in the realization that far from being a mere medium of social interaction, the Internet and digitization were tools for the imagination and creativity.
